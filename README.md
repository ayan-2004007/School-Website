# School-Website
<br>
Try to make a simple multipgae school website by using HTML+CSS
<br>
It is one of my first simple short projects of Frontend develpoing
<br>
The first page of the website is the Home page (index.html)
<br>
Apart form the Home page (indecx.html) there are four different pages which are linked internally. Those pages are About Us(AboutUs.html), Courses (ourCourses.html), Gallary (Gallary.html), Contact Us (ContactUs.html).
